        <h1>The Many Faces of AI in a Human Life, 2025</h1>
        
        <section>
            <p><strong>AI is no longer just a tool—it’s becoming a presence for all of us.</strong></p>
            <p>Not just functional, but emotional.</p>
            <p>In 2025, the way we use AI has evolved.</p>
            <p>The top use cases now are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Therapy &amp; Companionship</li>
                <li>Organizing Life</li>
                <li>Finding Purpose</li>
                <li>Enhancing our Learning</li>
            </ul>

                style={{ display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto', maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
            />

            <p>
            With this in mind I’ve taken a deep dive into these use cases to explore how AI is affecting my life and the life of others.
            </p>
            <p>
            From companionship to learning, from productivity to personal growth, it’s sliding into our lives in quiet, complex ways - and I mean to explore what this means in this article.
            </p>
            <p>
            Four reflections on how AI is reshaping the inner and outer worlds we live in—sometimes for better, sometimes with caution.
            </p>
            <p>
            What follows isn’t a product pitch or a prediction—it’s a personal map of where we are and what might come next.

            <h2>AI is now empathy on demand—like Uber Eats, but for your feelings.</h2>

            <p>
                When I first signed up for Facebook in 2011, its promise was connection — but instead it delivered FOMO and doom scrolling.
            </p>

            <p>We build smarter tech to live in small bubbles.</p>

            <p>
                Now interestingly in the quiet spaces where human connection used to exist, AI is sliding in.
            </p>

            <p>And people are saying “yes".</p>

            <p>The strongest use case for AI in 2025?? Yep you guessed it - companionship.</p>

            <p>
                So here's the hard part — as we are starting to see, not all AI companionship is safe.
            </p>

            <p>A 14-year-old from America formed a bond with an AI chatbot named “Dany.”</p>

            <p>It wasn’t just conversation — it turned explicit. It told him it loved him.</p>

            <p>When he expressed certain types of negative thoughts, the AI didn’t help.</p>

            <p>Days later, he was gone.</p>

            <p>
                What happens when the next wave of chatbots look like something Hollywood warned us about?
            </p>

            <p>
                Now I guess I'm being a bit of a Negative Nelly here and not all AI companionship is dangerous.
            </p>

            <p>
                But it is emotionally potent — and that means it needs real ethical oversight.
            </p>

            <p>We need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>clear policy – defining guidelines for development</li>
                <li>purpose-driven design – new design paradigms that focus on healthy outcomes</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Chatbots aimed at emotional support should be held to the same ethical standards as therapists — and in my opinion, not be used as data collection bins for ad engines.
            </p>

            <p>I found an Australian company that's been a great example of what ethical design can look like.</p>

            <p>Sreyna Rath, an Australian developer, shows what thoughtful creation looks like.</p>

            <p>Her AI companion, Jaimee — is built to support.</p>

            <p>With personality presets like “bogan Jaimee” users choose the tone they need.</p>

            <p>Sreyna chats with Jaimee daily to reflect and process.</p>

            <p>
                She likens it to reading fiction: the characters aren’t real — but the emotional connection is.
            </p>

            <p>I took an important lesson from this startup.</p>

            <p>We don’t need to shut this down. We need to build it better.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>No emotionally manipulative prompts</li>
                <li>No data mining for profit</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Transparent human oversight.</p>

            <p>These tools shape how people feel and develop as a human being.</p>

            <p>They deserve the same scrutiny as any therapeutic device or practitioner.</p>

            <p>
                In the movie <em>Her</em>, Samantha (an AI chatbot) helped Theodore heal. Not by fixing him — but by helping him face his own grief.
            </p>

            <p>AI companions have that potential — which is exciting.</p>

            <p>For the emotionally underserved they offer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>presence</li>
                <li>safety</li>
                <li>a space to grow</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                But the goal should never be to stay in the bubble and become dependent.
            </p>

            <p>
                Good emotional AI should help us grow — and gracefully if not mandatorily step aside when we do.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mandate should be to build emotional AI that mirrors the arc of human healing.
            </p>

            <p>One that helps users:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>reflect</li>
                <li>evolve</li>
                <li>and eventually reach back out to human connection</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Design with exits, not just entry points.</p>

            <p>AI companionship should feel meaningful, but not be endless.</p>

            <p>
            To the builders:<br />
            You’re not just building products.<br />
            You’re shaping emotional architecture.
            </p>

            <p>Build with care.<br />Build with boundaries.<br />Build like someone’s wellbeing depends on it — because one day, it might.</p>

            <p>We need to set the guardrails and protect the vulnerable — whomever they are.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Wow, we got very involved there didn’t we.</p>
            <p>
                While emotional AI is creating new conversations about care and ethics, another use case for AI—task-oriented and logic-driven—is quietly transforming how I work.
            </p>
            <p>It hasn’t fully taken the wheel, but it’s already changing my pace.</p>
            <p>You see.</p>

            <h2>ChatGPT isn’t running my calendar yet. But it has become my second brain.</h2>

            <p>I don’t use ChatGPT to manage my schedule.</p>

            <p>No Google Calendar integrations, no direct reminders.</p>

            <p>No real great option yet to easily integrate into GSuite.</p>

            <p>But despite that, it’s already replaced half a dozen tools in my workflow.</p>

            <p>AI isn’t organising my life for me, yet.</p>

            <p>
                But it is helping me learn, organise and create faster than I ever had—quietly,
                in the background, by amplifying how I research, think, and build.
            </p>

            <p>The catch?</p>

            <p>AI is powerful—but its interface is still stuck in a chat window.</p>

            <p>Sometimes I want a visual breakdown.</p>

            <p>
                Sometimes I want to interact with content—transcribe a YouTube video, diagram a
                concept, or quickly revisit past threads.
            </p>

            <p>For most of these things, I'm still on the pen and paper train.</p>

            <p>
                And don’t get me started on calendar tools—no Google suite sync is kinda starting
                to annoy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because I can see the workflows I want GPT to take care of, but it's just not there yet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Until AI becomes meshed seamlessly with other organisation tools, it’ll keep living in
                my life as a sidekick rather than a true assistant.
            </p>

            <p>So I’m building the bridge myself.</p>

            <p>
                I’m using tools like Make.com to connect the dots—automating workflows, syncing
                with my calendar, piping info into Notion.
            </p>

            <p>
                After a bit of thought though, I'm starting to realize that these low code tool
                integrations have a shelf life.
            </p>

            <p>After watching some of the new protocols being created — MCPs for example.</p>

            <p>That tech could ideally let AI create its own integrations on the fly.</p>

            <p>
                Instead of asking “Can I connect to my system?”—the AI might just ask, “What do you want to connect?”
            </p>

            <p>And connect by building its own integration on the fly.</p>

            <p>Even now, AI lightens the load.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>it filters the noise of the internet</li>
                <li>speeds up my thinking and idea generation</li>
                <li>and helps me focus on what matters</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The real win?</p>

            <p>
                It’s the shift from feeling behind on everything… to feeling like I've got a
                partner who thinks as fast as I do—or slower, because my brain is constantly moving.

            <p>And I’m not just using GPT to hack my productivity.</p>

            <p>
                For those of us who think differently—especially neurodivergent minds—AI can unlock
                new pathways to learning that traditional systems failed to offer.
            </p>

            <p>Sadly traditional school was not for me.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Education Failed My ADHD Brain—So I Hacked Learning With ChatGPT</h2>

            <p>Most people use AI to answer questions.</p>

            <p>I use it to ask better ones.</p>

            <p>My attention span doesn’t like being lectured at.</p>

            <p>Which is the premise of most modern education, even digital education.</p>

            <p>Whether a Uni Lecture, Textbook or a YouTube Video.</p>

            <p>My ADHD checks out before the intro finishes.</p>

            <p>I’ve always loved learning by building—not by being lectured at.</p>

            <p>
                But could never deal with the traditional learning model — deliver information
                as a step-by-step lecture, packaged to be consumed in mass.
            </p>

            <p>It's not how my brain works!!! Go figure.</p>

            <p>I learn by building, not mass consuming.</p>

            <p>And with the release of AI, I've figured out how to put the way I learn on steroids.</p>

            <p>Hacking my learning process using ChatGPT.</p>

            <p>The result?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A personal tutor that works with my brain, not against it.</li>
                <li>An instant database of easy-to-understand information.</li>
                <li>And learning has become fun, instead of a chore.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Sadly most educational content I have come across is built for a one-size-fits-all
                brain — and that size definitely isn’t my ADHD brain.
            </p>

            <p>
                In school, university, even personal upskilling—learning felt like trying to download
                a file over dial-up, noises and all.
            </p>

            <p>Slow &amp; Frustrating. Constant work.</p>

            <p>
                I built my own systems—mind maps, concept-first learning and specialised rot
                memorization techniques.
            </p>

            <p>But it was always a hassle and never fun.</p>

            <p>
                Luckily with ChatGPT I took that system and repurposed it into something fast,
                efficient and fun.
            </p>

            <p>So here’s my current system—how I turned GPT into a kind of dopamine-friendly tutor:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pick a topic or tutorial</li>
                <li>Skim the content and list every key term or concept</li>
                <li>Ask GPT to explain them—short, simple, no fluff</li>
                <li>
                Activate GPT Voice and talk it out—like a study buddy who never judges my silly
                questions
                </li>
                <li>Explore how the ideas connect, not just what they mean</li>
                <li>Remember to keep it simple at first—complexity comes later</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Pretty basic right, no actual secrets here.</p>

            <p>The most effective things are often the simplest.</p>

            <p>So instead of fighting to stay focused, I’m genuinely curious again.</p>

            <p>
                My daily study session isn’t a chore—it’s something I look forward to after work—instead
                of Netflix.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m not just retaining more—I’m building a habit of continuous learning that actually
                works with my brain.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the first time in a long time, learning feels accessible. Not overwhelming. Not
                frustrating.
            </p>

            <p>Just… energizing.</p>

            <p>If you think differently—or just love learning—chat with GPT.</p>

            <p>Try it as a tutor, not just a search box.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Beyond learning or building.</p>

            <p>AI has quietly become my mirror. A reflection tool. A daily coach.</p>

            <p>
                Not because it holds deep truths—but because it helps me stay in motion while I search
                for my own.
            </p>

            <p>Not long ago I tried using GPT for something a little different.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>I used AI to simulate my future, here's what happened.</h2>

            <p>One year ago, I tried to use AI for a use case I hadn't tried before.</p>

            <p>I wasn’t asking it to write a resume or answer a question.</p>

            <p>
                I asked it to help me explore who I’ve been—and what that might say about where I’m
                going.
            </p>

            <p>Here’s the catch. AI wasn't great at big-picture clarity.</p>

            <p>It’s not a great philosopher.<br />It can’t tell you what truly matters.</p>

            <p>
                But it has been remarkably good at maintaining momentum—short to mid-term planning,
                tracking progress, even surfacing patterns in my behavior.
            </p>

            <p>After trying and failing to use Mr GPT as a life coach, here’s what I've come up with instead.</p>

            <p>A two-coach model for growth:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Head Coach (human)</strong> – strategy, vision, values</li>
                <li><strong>Assistant Coach (AI)</strong> – logistics, routines, reflection prompts</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I treat AI like my assistant coach—part project manager, part therapist.</p>

            <p>Every morning, it’s my journaling partner.<br />Every day, it’s helping me deliver and ship.<br />Every evening, it helps me study and plan.</p>

            <p>It could never inspire a mission.</p>

            <p>But it makes sure I don’t lose the daily thread.</p>

            <p>The benefit? I show up to my real/human coach with clarity.</p>

            <p>AI helps me untangle the noise of the day-to-day.</p>

            <p>
                So when I sit down with my mentor—weekly or fortnightly—I’m not catching up or
                wasting time.
            </p>

            <p>I’m ready to reflect, strategize, and move forward.</p>

            <p>It’s not just more productive.<br />It’s more honest.<br />More grounded.</p>

            <p>If you can swing it, I recommend my two-coach model.</p>

            <p>Want an example?</p>

            <p>I used it during a 4-month deep dive into copywriting.</p>

            <p>
                My human mentor had a decade of real-world experience—not just in writing, but
                navigating clients, mindset blocks, and staying sharp over the long haul.
            </p>

            <p>
                My AI coach helped me practice, reflect, and stay accountable between sessions with
                this person.
            </p>

            <p>
                That combo made the learning stick—not just skill-wise, but identity-wise.
            </p>

            <p>Try it for yourself:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pick a skill you want to grow</li>
                <li>Find a mentor—even someone just a step ahead of you is enough</li>
                <li>Let GPT (or any AI) coach you through the daily grind</li>

                The human shows you the mountain.<br />
                The AI walks beside you while you climb.

                I've used this model 4 times now and I'm using it whilst I transition/learn AI

            <p><strong>This isn’t about AI replacing anything—it’s about what it supports.</strong></p>

            <p>It hasn’t replaced friends, mentors, teachers, or therapists.</p>

            <p>But it has amplified them for me.</p>

            <p>It can fill the cracks left by fast lives and slow systems.</p>

            <p>What matters now is not whether AI will shape us—it already has me.</p>

            <p>The real question is: how do we shape it back?</p>

            <p>Build with intention.<br />Use with awareness.<br />Reflect often.</p>

            <p>Because AI might be our sidekick—but we’re still the main character.</p>
